# Guide to create the wildcard SSL certificate using Certbot with Let's Encrypt:
#
# 1. Install Certbot and Let's Encrypt:
#    On Debian/Ubuntu:
#    sudo apt-get update
#    sudo apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
#
#    On CentOS/RHEL:
#    sudo yum install epel-release
#    sudo yum install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
#
# 2. Obtain the wildcard SSL certificate using the DNS challenge method:
#    sudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges=dns --email your-email@example.com --server https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory --agree-tos -d *.wildcard.com -d wildcard.com
#
#    Replace your-email@example.com with your email address and wildcard.com with your domain name.
#
# 3. Certbot will prompt you to create DNS TXT records for the domain verification:
#    - Log in to your DNS provider's management console.
#    - Create a new TXT record for the domain with the name `_acme-challenge.wildcard.com` and the value provided by Certbot.
#    - Repeat the process for `_acme-challenge.www.wildcard.com` if necessary.
#    - Wait for the DNS changes to propagate, which can take a few minutes.
#
# 4. Once the DNS records are verified, Certbot will obtain the certificates and store them in /etc/letsencrypt/live/wildcard.com/.
#    Update the ssl_certificate and ssl_certificate_key directives with the correct paths as shown below.
#
# 5. Set up a cron job to automatically renew the certificates:
#    sudo crontab -e
#    Add the following line to renew the certificates every day at 2:30 AM:
#    30 2 * * * /usr/bin/certbot renew --quiet
#
# 6. Reload Nginx to apply the new certificates:
#    sudo systemctl reload nginx
#

#
# Specifies the path to the SSL certificate file. This file contains the
# public key and any intermediate certificates needed to establish a secure
# connection.
#
ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/wildcard.com/fullchain.pem;

#
# Specifies the path to the SSL certificate key file. This file contains
# the private key associated with the SSL certificate.
#
ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/wildcard.com/privkey.pem;
